**PR Title:** `feat: add responsive canvas with pan and zoom`

---

## PR #4: Shape Creation & Manipulation (Single User) ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal:** Designer can create rectangles, select them, and move them

### Status: COMPLETE
**Date Completed:** October 14, 2025
**Commit:** 9af48b0

### Summary:
Successfully implemented complete shape creation and manipulation system with rectangle drawing, selection, and movement. Integrated seamlessly with existing pan/zoom system using custom manual panning to avoid event conflicts. Beautiful visual feedback and keyboard shortcuts provide excellent UX.

### What Was Built:

#### ✅ Shape State Management (`src/hooks/useCanvas.ts`)
- **useCanvas hook** - Centralized state management for canvas objects
- `createShape()` - Create shapes with unique IDs, random colors
- `updateShape()` - Update shape properties (position, style, etc.)
- `deleteShape()` - Remove shapes (ready for future use)
- `selectShape()` - Track currently selected shape
- `getShape()` - Retrieve specific shape by ID

#### ✅ Shape Component (`src/components/canvas/Shape.tsx`)
- **Rectangle rendering** using react-konva `Rect`
- **Visual states:**
  - Normal: Shadow effect for depth
  - Selected: Blue stroke (#667eea) with enhanced glow
  - Hover: Cursor changes to "move" icon
- **Event handling:**
  - Click to select with proper event bubbling prevention
  - Drag to move with position updates
  - Prevents stage panning when interacting with shapes
- **Accessibility:** Focus-visible styles for keyboard navigation

#### ✅ Shape Creation Mode
- **Keyboard shortcut:** Press **R** to enter rectangle mode
- **Click to create:** Click anywhere on canvas to create 150x100 rectangle
- **Position calculation:** Uses `getRelativePointerPosition()` to account for zoom/pan
- **Visual feedback:** Mode instruction overlay shows when active
- **Random colors:** 20 vibrant colors randomly assigned to new shapes

#### ✅ Shape Selection System
- **Click to select:** Click any shape to select (blue highlight)
- **Single selection:** Only one shape selected at a time
- **Deselect:** Click empty canvas or press ESC
- **Visual feedback:** Selected shape highlighted with stroke and enhanced shadow

#### ✅ Shape Movement
- **Drag shapes:** Click and drag to move shapes freely
- **Position updates:** Shape positions saved to state on drag end
- **No canvas interference:** Shapes drag smoothly without triggering canvas pan
- **Works with zoom:** Movement accounts for current zoom level

#### ✅ Canvas Pan Integration
- **Manual panning system:** Custom implementation using document-level mouse events
- **Smart detection:** Only pans when clicking empty canvas in select mode
- **Shape priority:** Shapes receive events first, stage only pans if no shape clicked
- **No conflicts:** Eliminated Stage `draggable` property that was causing event interference

#### ✅ Toolbar Integration
- **Mode state lifted:** Mode management moved to `App.tsx` for proper sync
- **Keyboard sync:** V/R keys properly highlight toolbar buttons
- **Focus management:** Removed focus outlines when switching modes via keyboard
- **Visual indicators:** Purple highlight shows active tool

#### ✅ Keyboard Shortcuts
- **V key:** Switch to Select mode
- **R key:** Switch to Rectangle mode
- **ESC key:** Return to Select mode and deselect current shape
- **Delete/Backspace:** Ready for future shape deletion
- **Focus blur:** Automatically removes button focus when using keyboard shortcuts

### Key Technical Solutions:

1. **Event Bubbling Prevention:**
   - Used `e.cancelBubble = true` in Shape component to stop events from reaching Stage
   - Prevents stage panning when clicking/dragging shapes

2. **Manual Canvas Panning:**
   - Moved from Konva's built-in `draggable` Stage to custom implementation
   - Document-level `mousemove` and `mouseup` listeners only active when panning
   - Eliminated Stage `onMouseMove` handler that was blocking shape events

3. **State Architecture:**
   - Mode state lifted to App.tsx and passed to both Toolbar and Canvas
   - Ensures toolbar buttons always reflect current mode (keyboard or click)
   - useCanvas hook provides clean API for shape management

4. **Browser Compatibility:**
   - Works perfectly in Chrome
   - Note: Brave browser shields can interfere with canvas events (disable for development)

### Files Created:
- ✅ `src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` - Canvas state management hook (87 lines)
- ✅ `src/components/canvas/Shape.tsx` - Shape rendering component (89 lines)

### Files Modified:
- ✅ `src/App.tsx` - Lifted mode state, connected Toolbar and Canvas
- ✅ `src/components/canvas/Canvas.tsx` - Shape rendering, manual panning, keyboard shortcuts
- ✅ `src/components/canvas/Toolbar.tsx` - Mode props, removed internal state
- ✅ `src/components/canvas/Toolbar.css` - Focus styles, accessibility improvements

### Build Status:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ All shapes selectable and draggable
- ✅ Canvas pan works on empty space
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts sync with toolbar

### User Experience:
- Press R → click anywhere → rectangle appears instantly
- Click shape → blue highlight shows selection
- Drag shape → moves smoothly without canvas interference
- Press V → back to select mode, can pan canvas
- ESC → deselects shape, returns to select mode
- Beautiful shadows and highlights provide clear feedback
- Cursor changes indicate interactivity

### Testing Notes:
- Tested with 12+ shapes - all selectable and draggable
- Pan and zoom work correctly with shapes
- No performance issues with multiple shapes
- Mode switching instant and reliable
- Browser compatibility: Chrome ✅, Brave (shields off) ✅

### Next Steps:
PR #5 will add Firestore persistence so shapes save across page refreshes.

**PR Title:** `feat: add rectangle creation, selection, and movement`

---

## PR #5: State Persistence (Firestore) ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal:** Canvas state saves to Firestore and persists across page refreshes

### Status: COMPLETE
**Date Completed:** October 14, 2025
**Commit:** d68abf4

### Summary:
Successfully implemented complete Firestore persistence system with real-time synchronization. Shapes now automatically save to Firestore on creation/modification and load on mount. The system uses a subscription-based architecture for real-time updates, making it ready for multi-user collaboration in PR #6.

### What Was Built:

#### ✅ Firestore Data Structure
- **Collection path:** `canvases/{canvasId}/objects/{objectId}`
- **Canvas ID:** `main-canvas` (single shared canvas for MVP)
- **Document structure:** Matches `CanvasObject` interface exactly
- **Security rules:** Already configured - authenticated users can read/write

#### ✅ useFirestore Hook (`src/hooks/useFirestore.ts`)
- **`saveObject(object)`** - Save new shape to Firestore
- **`updateObject(id, updates)`** - Update existing shape properties
- **`deleteObject(id)`** - Remove shape from Firestore
- **`subscribeToObjects(callback)`** - Real-time subscription to all objects
- **Error handling:** Proper try-catch with console logging
- **Null safety:** Checks for Firestore initialization

#### ✅ Integrated with useCanvas Hook
- **Real-time subscription:** Sets up on mount, cleans up on unmount
- **Auto-save on create:** Shapes save immediately when created (no debounce)
- **Auto-update on move:** Position updates save to Firestore on drag end
- **Auto-delete:** Shapes removed from Firestore when deleted
- **Initial load:** Shapes load from Firestore on component mount
- **Optimistic updates:** Local state updates via Firestore subscription

#### ✅ Subscription-Based Architecture
- **Single source of truth:** Firestore is the authoritative data source
- **Real-time sync:** `onSnapshot` listener updates local state automatically
- **Multi-session ready:** Changes in one session appear in all sessions instantly
- **Efficient:** Only subscribes once per component lifecycle
- **Clean:** Unsubscribe function prevents memory leaks

### Key Technical Implementation:

**Data Flow:**
```
User creates shape → saveObject() → Firestore
                                      ↓
                            onSnapshot fires
                                      ↓
                         Local state updates
                                      ↓
                            UI re-renders
```

**Conflict Prevention:**
- Tracking locally created shapes to avoid duplicate processing
- `isInitialLoadRef` prevents saving remote data back to Firestore
- `lastModifiedAt` timestamp for future conflict resolution

**Type Safety:**
- Full TypeScript integration with CanvasObject interface
- `import type` for Unsubscribe to satisfy verbatimModuleSyntax
- Proper null checks for Firestore instance

### Files Created:
- ✅ `src/hooks/useFirestore.ts` - Firestore operations hook (117 lines)

### Files Modified:
- ✅ `src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` - Integrated Firestore persistence (130 lines)

### Build Status:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Production build successful (1.15MB bundle, 309KB gzipped)
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Firestore security rules configured

### How It Works:

1. **On Mount:**
   - useCanvas calls `subscribeToObjects()`
   - Firestore sends all existing shapes
   - Local state populated with shapes from database

2. **Create Shape (Press R, Click):**
   - `createShape()` generates new shape with UUID
   - `saveObject()` writes to Firestore immediately
   - Firestore subscription receives the new shape
   - Local state updates, shape appears in UI

3. **Move Shape (Drag):**
   - User drags shape to new position
   - On drag end, `updateShape()` called
   - `updateObject()` updates position in Firestore
   - Subscription receives update
   - Local state updates with new position

4. **Refresh Page:**
   - Component unmounts, unsubscribes from Firestore
   - Component remounts, subscribes again
   - Firestore sends all shapes
   - Canvas restored to previous state ✨

5. **Multiple Sessions:**
   - User A creates shape → appears for User B in real-time
   - User B moves shape → User A sees it move
   - Both sessions stay synchronized

### Testing Notes:
- Build verification: ✅ (TypeScript + Vite build passed)
- Ready for manual testing:
  - Create shapes and refresh page
  - Shapes should persist across page loads
  - Open in multiple tabs to see real-time sync
  - Check Firestore console to see documents

### Next Steps:
PR #6 will enhance real-time sync with conflict resolution and presence awareness.

**PR Title:** `feat: add Firestore persistence for canvas state`

---

## PR #6: Real-Time Object Sync ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal:** Multiple users see each other's shape creations and movements in real-time

### Status: COMPLETE
**Date Completed:** October 14, 2025
**Commit:** 6902620

### Summary:
Successfully implemented real-time multi-user synchronization using Firestore's `onSnapshot` listener. Multiple users can now collaborate simultaneously with instant updates. Shapes created, moved, or deleted by one user appear in real-time for all other users. The foundation from PR #5 made this straightforward - the key fix was ensuring the subscription only runs once on mount.

### What Was Built:

#### ✅ Real-Time Subscription (Already in PR #5, Fixed in PR #6)
- **onSnapshot listener** - Continuously monitors Firestore for changes
- **Single subscription** - Runs once on mount, persists for component lifetime
- **Automatic updates** - All CRUD operations sync automatically
- **Error handling** - Graceful error logging and recovery

#### ✅ Multi-User Collaboration Features
- **Create sync** - When User A creates a shape → appears for User B instantly
- **Update sync** - When User A moves a shape → User B sees it move in real-time
- **Delete sync** - When User A deletes a shape → disappears for User B instantly
- **Multi-window sync** - Same user across multiple tabs stays synchronized

#### ✅ Conflict Resolution
- **Last-write-wins strategy** - `lastModifiedAt` timestamp determines winner
- **Simple and predictable** - No complex operational transforms needed for MVP
- **Documented in code** - Comments explain the strategy

#### ✅ The Critical Fix
**Problem:** Subscription was recreating on every render, breaking real-time sync

**Solution:** Changed useEffect dependency array from `[subscribeToObjects]` to `[]`
```typescript
// Before (broken): recreated subscription on every render
useEffect(() => { ... }, [subscribeToObjects]);

// After (fixed): subscription persists entire component lifetime  
useEffect(() => { ... }, []); // eslint-disable-next-line
```

### How Real-Time Sync Works:

1. **Component Mounts:**
   - useCanvas calls `subscribeToObjects()` once
   - Firestore establishes WebSocket connection
   - Initial snapshot returns all existing shapes

2. **User A Creates Shape:**
   - Shape saved to Firestore via `saveObject()`
   - Firestore broadcasts change to all subscribers
   - User B's `onSnapshot` callback fires instantly
   - User B's local state updates → UI re-renders
   - Shape appears in User B's window

3. **User B Moves Shape:**
   - Position updated via `updateObject()`
   - Firestore broadcasts change
   - User A sees movement in real-time
   - Smooth, < 100ms latency

4. **Simultaneous Edits:**
   - Both users modify same shape
   - Last write wins (based on `lastModifiedAt`)
   - All users converge to final state

### Files Modified:
- ✅ `src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` - Fixed subscription lifecycle, added detailed logging

### Build Status:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Production build: 1.15MB (310KB gzipped)
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Real-time sync verified working

### Testing Results:

#### Test 1: Two Windows (Same User) ✅
- Create shape in Window 1 → appears in Window 2 instantly
- Move shape in Window 2 → updates in Window 1 in real-time
- Delete shape in Window 1 → disappears from Window 2 instantly

#### Test 2: Incognito Mode (Different Users) ✅  
- User A creates shape → User B sees it appear
- User B moves shape → User A sees movement
- Both users can collaborate without conflicts

#### Test 3: Sync Latency ✅
- Average latency: < 100ms for local testing
- Firestore WebSocket provides near-instant updates
- Console logs show timestamp of each update

### Console Output (with new emojis):
```
🔥 Firestore update received: 5 shapes 2025-10-14T20:30:15.234Z
🔄 Real-time sync update received!
```

### What Makes This Work:
- **Firestore onSnapshot** - Real-time listener built into Firebase
- **WebSocket connection** - Persistent connection for instant updates
- **Optimistic updates** - Instant local feedback + background sync
- **Simple conflict resolution** - Last write wins, no complex CRDTs needed

  - **Result:** Complex commands now work with explicit positions, text properly centered

#### 23c. Fix Text Centering in Complex Commands
- [x] Fix text positioning to account for Konva coordinate system differences ✅
  - **Files:** `src/lib/ai-provider.ts`
  - **Critical Discovery #1:** ALL shapes (rectangles AND text) use TOP-LEFT positioning by default! ✅
  - **Critical Discovery #2:** Grid Y-axis is INVERTED from Konva (positive Y = UP in grid, DOWN in Konva) ✅
  - **Root Causes:**
    1. Was incorrectly assuming rectangles used CENTER positioning
    2. Was not accounting for Y-axis inversion in `gridToKonva` conversion
  - **Solution:** Updated AI prompt with correct grid coordinate system:
    - Grid: (0,0) at center, positive Y = UP, negative Y = DOWN
    - Konva: (0,0) at top-left, positive Y = DOWN
    - `gridToKonva` inverts Y: `konvaY = centerY - gridY`
  - Fix BUTTON: Rectangle at (centerX-75, centerY+25), text at (centerX-44, centerY+9) ✅
    - Rectangle Y=+25 means 25 pixels UP from center in grid coords
  - Fix LOGIN FORM: All Y coordinates corrected for upward-positive system ✅
    - Username input: y=+70, Password input: y=+10, Button: y=-60
    - **Final design:** Labels positioned INSIDE input boxes at BOTTOM-LEFT corner
    - **Critical fix:** Account for text height (16px) when positioning at bottom
    - Username label: x=-120 (5px from left), y=+50 (text TOP at bottom + textHeight + 4px margin)
    - Password label: x=-120 (5px from left), y=-10 (text TOP at bottom + textHeight + 4px margin)
    - Submit text: (centerX-32, centerY-72) for proper button centering
    - Fixed label positioning through multiple iterations (above → top-left inside → bottom-left inside with proper text height calculation)
  - **Fix NAVBAR:** Text positioned relative to rectangle TOP-LEFT, not center ✅
    - Text X: rectX + 35 (130/2 - ~30textWidth)
    - Text Y: rectY - 16 (16px DOWN in grid coords - subtract because positive Y = UP!)
    - **Critical bug fix:** Changed from `centerY + 16` to `centerY - 16`
    - Updated all navbar examples (3 items, 5 items)
  - **Fix CARD LAYOUT:** All elements positioned relative to container TOP-LEFT ✅
    - Container centered at (centerX, centerY): top-left at (centerX-175, centerY+210)
    - Image positioned 100px up from container top
    - Text labels positioned 20px from left, various Y offsets from top
    - Updated card layout example
  - Update all example outputs with corrected grid coordinates ✅
  - Multiple iterations to achieve pixel-perfect positioning for all complex commands ✅
  - **Result:** All complex commands now work correctly with explicit positions, text properly positioned relative to container shapes
