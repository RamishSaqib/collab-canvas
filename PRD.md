**Backend:** Firebase (Firestore, Realtime Database, Auth, Hosting)  
**AI:** OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo

## Core Requirements
- Pan and zoom (60 FPS performance)
- Shape support (rectangles, circles, triangles, text)
- Real-time sync (<100ms for objects, <50ms for cursors)
- User authentication (email/password + Google OAuth)
- Presence awareness
- Multi-user collaboration (5+ concurrent users)

## Performance Targets
- 60 FPS during all interactions
- <100ms object sync latency
