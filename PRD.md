3. ✅ Added `saveAllShapesToFirestore()` with full diff and sync logic
4. ✅ Clear All triggers change notifications properly
5. ✅ Cancel on exit truly discards unsaved changes
6. ✅ Save Project performs full Firestore sync (adds, updates, deletes)

**Behavior:**
- ✅ Any canvas edit marks as "unsaved" without persisting
- ✅ Only "Save Project" button persists changes to Firestore
- ✅ Reload without saving truly discards changes
- ✅ Works like traditional desktop apps with explicit save

---

### PR #24: Project Management Enhancements ✅
*Oct 18, 2025 - COMPLETE*

**Features:**
1. ✅ **Duplicate Projects** - Clone projects with all shapes and thumbnails
2. ✅ **Favorite Projects** - Star/unstar projects for quick access
3. ✅ **Project Thumbnails** - Automatic thumbnail generation with white background
4. ✅ **List View Layout** - Horizontal card layout for list view
5. ✅ **Enhanced UI** - Hover effects and smooth animations

**Implementation Details:**
- `useProjects` hook: Added `duplicateProject()` and `toggleFavorite()` functions
- `ProjectCard`: Added favorite star button (top-right overlay, always visible when favorited)
- `ProjectCard`: Added duplicate option in context menu
- `useThumbnail` hook: Generate JPEG thumbnails with white background (excludes Transformer)
- List view CSS for horizontal card layout with thumbnail on left
- Clear All properly removes thumbnail from Firestore using `deleteField()`

**Technical:**
- Duplicate copies all shapes from source project subcollection
- Thumbnail generation: Captures canvas, adds white background, converts to JPEG (80% quality)
- Favorite state stored in Firestore `isFavorite` field
- Batch writes for efficient shape duplication
- Null values converted to `deleteField()` for proper Firestore field removal

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed duplicate error with undefined thumbnailUrl
- Fixed thumbnail not capturing shapes (filter by className instead of name)
- Fixed black background in thumbnails (added white canvas layer)
- Fixed Clear All not removing thumbnail (use deleteField for null values)
- Fixed list view layout (horizontal cards with proper spacing)

### PR #25: Project Sorting & Filtering ✅
*Oct 18, 2025 - COMPLETE*

**Features:**
1. ✅ **Filter Tabs** - All, Favorites, Recent (7 days)
2. ✅ **Sort Options** - Last Accessed, Created Date, Alphabetical
3. ✅ **Search Functionality** - Real-time project name search
4. ✅ **Smart Empty States** - Context-aware messages for filtered views

**Implementation Details:**
- Filter state management: `'all' | 'favorites' | 'recent'`
- Sort state management: `'lastAccessed' | 'created' | 'alphabetical'`
- `useMemo` for efficient filtering and sorting
- Combined filter + search + sort pipeline
- Active states for filter tabs and sort dropdown

**User Experience:**
- Real-time search as you type
- Filter tabs with visual active states
- Sort dropdown with 3 options
- Empty states show helpful messages:
  - "No favorite projects" → "Star projects to see them here"
  - "No recent projects" → "Projects accessed in the last 7 days will appear here"
  - "No matching projects" → Shows search query

**Technical:**
- Single `useMemo` hook for all filtering/sorting logic
- Filter → Search → Sort pipeline order
- Recent projects: Last 7 days based on `lastAccessedAt`
- Case-insensitive search
- Alphabetical sort uses `localeCompare` for proper string sorting

### PR #26: Multi-User Collaboration - Backend + Project Menu Fixes ✅
*Oct 18, 2025 - COMPLETE*

**Backend Collaboration Features:**
1. ✅ **Data Model** - `Collaborator` interface with role-based permissions
2. ✅ **Project Schema** - Added `collaborators[]` and `isPublic` fields
3. ✅ **Permission System** - Helper functions for access control (`canView`, `canEdit`, `canDelete`, etc.)
4. ✅ **Firestore Rules** - Updated security rules for collaboration support
5. ✅ **Owner Initialization** - Projects automatically add creator as owner in collaborators array

**Bug Fixes:**
1. ✅ **Project Menu Persistence** - Fixed menu not closing when clicking away
2. ✅ **Delete Option Missing** - Restored "Delete" option in project menu
3. ✅ **Rename Feature** - Added "Rename" option to project menu

**Implementation Details:**
- `CollaboratorRole`: `'owner' | 'editor' | 'viewer'`
- `Collaborator`: `{ userId, role, addedAt, addedBy }`
- Permission utilities in `src/utils/permissions.ts`
- Firestore security rules simplified (fine-grained permissions enforced in frontend)
- Project creation includes `collaborators: [{ userId, role: 'owner', addedAt }]`
- `useEffect` with document click listener to close menu on outside click
- `updateProject()` function for renaming projects

**User Experience:**
- Project menu now has 3 options: ✏️ Rename, 📋 Duplicate, 🗑️ Delete
- Menu closes automatically when clicking outside
- Rename uses native browser prompt (can be upgraded to modal later)
- All backend infrastructure ready for collaboration UI in PR #27

**Technical:**
- New file: `src/utils/permissions.ts` with 8 permission helper functions
- Updated: `src/lib/types.ts` with collaboration types
- Updated: `src/hooks/useProjects.ts` to initialize owner as collaborator
- Updated: `firestore.rules` with collaboration support
- Fixed: `ProjectCard.tsx` menu behavior with click-outside detection
